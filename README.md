# Codex Auth

![command list](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/6c13a2d6-f9da-47ea-8ec8-0394fc072d40)

`codex-auth` is a command-line tool for switching Codex accounts.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> For **Codex CLI** users, after switching accounts, you must fully exit `codex` (type `/exit` or close the terminal session) and start it again for the new account to take effect.
>
> If you want seamless automatic account switching without restarting `codex`, use forked [codext](https://github.com/Loongphy/codext), but you need to build it yourself because there is no prebuilt install method yet.

## Supported Platforms

`codex-auth` works with these Codex clients:

- Codex CLI
- VS Code extension
- Codex App

For the best experience, install the Codex CLI even if you mainly use the VS Code extension or the App, because it makes adding accounts easier:

```shell
npm install -g @openai/codex
```

After that, you can use `codex login` or `codex-auth login` to sign in and add accounts more easily.

## Install

- npm:

```shell
npm install -g @loongphy/codex-auth
```

  You can also run it without a global install:

```shell
npx @loongphy/codex-auth list
```

  npm packages currently support Linux x64, macOS x64, macOS arm64, and Windows x64.

- Linux/macOS/WSL2:

```shell
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/loongphy/codex-auth/main/scripts/install.sh | bash
```

  The installer writes the install dir to your shell profile by default.
  Supported profiles: `~/.bashrc`/`~/.bash_profile`/`~/.profile`, `~/.zshrc`/`~/.zprofile`, `~/.config/fish/config.fish`.
  Use `--no-add-to-path` to skip profile updates.

- Windows (PowerShell):

```powershell
irm https://raw.githubusercontent.com/loongphy/codex-auth/main/scripts/install.ps1 | iex
```

  The installer adds the install dir to current/user `PATH` by default.
  Use `-NoAddToPath` to skip user `PATH` persistence.

## Run After You Make Modifications

If you are modifying this repository locally and want to run the CLI from source:

```shell
zig build run -- list
```

To run the full Zig test entry used by CI:

```shell
zig test src/main.zig -lc
```

## Clone, Build, and Local Setup

```shell
git clone https://github.com/loongphy/codex-auth.git
cd codex-auth
```

1. Install Zig `0.14.x` and ensure `zig` is on your `PATH`.
2. Build the binary:

```shell
zig build
```

3. Run from source:

```shell
zig build run -- list
```

4. Optional: install to your Zig prefix so `codex-auth` is directly runnable:

```shell
zig build install
```

5. Prepare your Codex auth data:
   - If you already use Codex CLI, `~/.codex/auth.json` is usually present.
   - Otherwise run `codex login`, then `codex-auth login` or `codex-auth import <path>`.

## Full Commands

```shell
codex-auth list # list all accounts
codex-auth login # run `codex login`, then add the current account
codex-auth switch [<email>] # switch active account (interactive or partial/fragment match)
codex-auth import <path> [--alias <alias>] # smart import: file -> single import, folder -> batch import
codex-auth import --purge [<path>] # rebuild registry.json from auth files for the current version
codex-auth remove # remove accounts (interactive multi-select)
codex-auth status # show auto-switch/service/api usage status
codex-auth config auto enable|disable # manage background auto-switching
codex-auth config auto --5h <percent> [--weekly <percent>] # configure auto-switch thresholds
codex-auth config api enable|disable # choose API-only or local-sessions-only usage refresh
```

Compatibility note: `codex-auth add` is still accepted as a deprecated alias for `codex-auth login`.

### Examples

List accounts (default table with borders):

```shell
codex-auth list
```

Add the currently logged-in Codex account:

```shell
codex-auth login
```

Import an auth.json backup:

```shell
codex-auth import /path/to/auth.json --alias personal
```

Batch import from a folder:

```shell
codex-auth import /path/to/auth-exports
```

Rebuild `registry.json` from imported auth files:

```shell
codex-auth import --purge /path/to/auth-exports
codex-auth import --purge                  # rebuild from ~/.codex/accounts/*.auth.json
```

Switch accounts (interactive list shows email, 5h, weekly, last activity):

```shell
codex-auth switch               # arrow + number input, q to quit
```

Before the switch picker opens, `codex-auth switch` refreshes the current active account's usage once so the currently selected row is not stale. It does not refresh the newly selected account after the switch completes.

![command switch](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/48a86acf-2a6e-4206-a8c4-591989fdc0df)

Switch account non-interactively (for scripts/other CLIs):

```shell
codex-auth switch user
```

If multiple accounts match, interactive selection is shown, and you can press `q` to quit without switching.

Remove accounts (interactive multi-select):

```shell
codex-auth remove
```

Show current status:

```shell
codex-auth status
```

Enable background auto-switching:

```shell
codex-auth config auto enable
```

Configure auto-switch thresholds:

```shell
codex-auth config auto --5h 12
codex-auth config auto --5h 12 --weekly 8
```

Use API-only usage refresh:

```shell
codex-auth config api enable
```

Use pure local rollout refresh without any API calls:

```shell
codex-auth config api disable
```

Use a third-party OpenAI-compatible usage API provider endpoint:

```shell
CODEX_AUTH_USAGE_API_ENDPOINT="https://your-provider.example.com/backend-api/wham/usage" codex-auth list
```

Prefer official endpoint first, then automatically fall back to a third-party endpoint when official usage requests fail or return no usable usage windows:

```shell
CODEX_AUTH_USAGE_API_FALLBACK_ENDPOINT="https://your-provider.example.com/backend-api/wham/usage" codex-auth list
```

Notes:

- The endpoint must be a valid `https://` URL with a host and return an OpenAI-compatible usage payload.
- If the variable is unset (or empty), `codex-auth` uses the default OpenAI endpoint.
- `CODEX_AUTH_USAGE_API_FALLBACK_ENDPOINT` is optional. When set, `codex-auth` still tries the primary endpoint first, then tries the fallback endpoint only when the primary request fails or returns no usable windows.
- This only changes where usage refresh requests are sent. It does not rewrite Codex app settings or chat history files.

When auto-switching is enabled, a background worker refreshes the active account's usage from the configured source and silently switches accounts when:

- 5h remaining drops below the configured 5h threshold (default `10%`), or
- weekly remaining drops below the configured weekly threshold (default `5%`)

Accounts without any usage snapshot are treated as fresh accounts with full quota when ranking candidates.
On Linux/WSL, background checks run through `systemd --user` as a oneshot service triggered every minute by a timer. On Windows, a user scheduled task runs the same one-shot check every minute. On macOS, the background worker remains long-running.
Successful foreground `codex-auth` commands also reconcile the managed auto-switch service, so a disabled config removes stale background units while an enabled background worker is refreshed onto the current binary after upgrades or stale service drift.
Changing thresholds updates `registry.json`; Linux/WSL and Windows pick them up on the next scheduled run, while macOS picks them up on the next polling cycle, without a service restart.
Changing `config api` updates `registry.json` immediately; `api enable` means API-only and `api disable` means local-sessions-only.
`codex-auth help` also shows whether auto-switching and usage API calls are currently enabled.

## Q&A

### Why is my usage limit not refreshing?

If `codex-auth` is using local-only usage refresh, it reads the newest `~/.codex/sessions/**/rollout-*.jsonl` file. Recent Codex builds often write `token_count` events with `rate_limits: null`. The local files may still contain older usable usage limit data, but in practice they can lag by several hours, so local-only refresh may show a usage limit snapshot from hours ago instead of your latest state.

- Upstream Codex issue: [openai/codex#14880](https://github.com/openai/codex/issues/14880)

You can switch usage limit refresh to the usage API with:

```shell
codex-auth config api enable
```

Then confirm the current mode with:

```shell
codex-auth status
```

`status` should show `usage: api`.

Upgrade notes:

- If you are upgrading from `v0.1.x` to the latest `v0.2.x`, API usage refresh is enabled by default.
- If you previously used an early `v0.2` prerelease/test build and `status` still shows `usage: local`, run `codex-auth config api enable` once to switch to API mode.

## Disclaimer

This project is provided as-is and use is at your own risk.

**Usage Data Refresh Source:**
`codex-auth` supports two sources for refreshing account usage/usage limit information:

1. **API (default):** When `config api enable` is on, the tool makes direct HTTPS requests to OpenAI's endpoints using your account's access token. This is the current default mode.
2. **Local-only:** When `config api disable` is on, the tool scans local `~/.codex/sessions/*/rollout-*.jsonl` files without making API calls. This mode is safer, but it can be less accurate because recent Codex rollout files often contain `rate_limits: null`, so the latest local usage limit data may lag by several hours.

**API Call Declaration:**
By enabling API-based usage refresh, this tool will send your ChatGPT access token to the configured usage endpoint to fetch current quota information. By default this endpoint is `https://chatgpt.com/backend-api/wham/usage`, and you can override it with `CODEX_AUTH_USAGE_API_ENDPOINT`. This behavior may be detected by the provider and could violate their terms of service, potentially leading to account suspension or other risks. The decision to use this feature and any resulting consequences are entirely yours.
